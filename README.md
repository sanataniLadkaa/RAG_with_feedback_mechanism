# Dynamic Feedback-Driven Knowledge Base with RAG and ChromaDB

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing AI systems by developing a **Feedback-Driven Knowledge Base** using the combined power of **ChromaDB** and a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model. The system leverages user feedback to dynamically improve the accuracy, relevance, and intelligence of responses.

### Key Milestones

1. **Advanced Data Management with ChromaDB**  
   - Leveraged ChromaDB to manage and retrieve embedded vectors.
   - Ensured scalability and efficiency in handling growing data needs.

2. **Intelligent Retrieval with RAG Model**  
   - Implemented a RAG model that dynamically improves responses based on contextual data.
   - Ensured accurate and relevant information retrieval from the knowledge base.

3. **Automated Feedback Integration**  
   - Integrated a feedback loop, utilizing ChromaDB’s capabilities for continuous updates.
   - Feedback directly refines database entries, boosting system accuracy over time.

4. **Robust Testing & Validation**  
   - Performed comprehensive tests to ensure consistent and reliable system behavior.
   - Validated data handling strategies to confirm the effectiveness of updates.

### Technical Insights

- **ChromaDB & SQLite**: Used Python's `sqlite3` library alongside ChromaDB to manage seamless data transactions and ensure reliable storage solutions.
- **Feedback Loop**: Developed an automated feedback loop that enhances data based on user interactions, increasing the RAG model’s effectiveness.
- **Logging & Debugging**: Integrated advanced logging for operations tracking, improving troubleshooting and debugging.

### Looking Ahead

- **Expanded Database Schema**: Plan to expand the schema to support more complex queries.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Working towards automating the application of user preferences through predictive analytics.
- **RAG Model Refinements**: Continuously refining the model for even more accurate, user-focused responses.
